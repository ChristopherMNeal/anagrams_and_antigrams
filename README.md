#### _An application to determine whether two words are anagrams of each other_

## Technologies Used

* _Ruby_
* _RSpec_
* _IRB_
* _Pry_

## Description

_This project was created for Epicodus bootcamp to show proficiency in Ruby coding, RSpec testing, IRB, and Pry. The application is for testing whether two words or phrases are anagrams, antigrams, or otherwise._

_The program checks the entered words by the following criteria:_
_Words must contain one vowel (a, e, i, o, u), unless they are on the list of common words with only 'y' as a vowel._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/christophermneal/anagrams_and_antigrams) with `git clone https://github.com/ChristopherMNeal/anagrams_and_antigrams` or download and open the Zip on your local machine._
* _Next, navigate to the root directory of the project with `cd anagrams_and_antigrams`, then run `bundle install` in the terminal to install Pry and RSpec_
* _Then, still in the root directory, run `ruby ruby_script.rb` to start the script and use the program._
* _To run all RSpec tests, run `rspec`_
* _Finally run `code .` in the terminal to open the project folder in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and view the code._
